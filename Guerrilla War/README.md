## Guerrilla War Autosplitter for LiveSplit <br />
Timer starts when player gains control, splits occur when player loses control after boss fight and on final fade out. <br />
<br />
Known bug: If you map your emulator reset and LiveSplit reset to the same key, whenever you have a gold in the splits and LiveSplit is waiting on you to choose 
whether or not to save, the emulator will have already changed states. This causes a fake gold on the current split. <br />
To fix this make sure to reset LiveSplit and accept golds BEFORE resetting the emulator.
