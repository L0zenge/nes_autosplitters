## Ninja Gaiden Autosplitter for LiveSplit <br />
This will start time timer either manually or as soon as Ryu starts moving on Act 1 (i.e. gained control). <br />
Splits occur when timer reaches zero after boss fight therefore you will have a split for each act plus another on Jaquio and the Demon. <br />
<br />
Known bug: If you map your emulator reset and LiveSplit reset to the same key, whenever you have a gold in the splits and LiveSplit is waiting on you to choose 
whether or not to save, the emulator will have already changed states. This causes a fake gold on the current split. <br />
To fix this make sure to reset LiveSplit and accept golds BEFORE resetting the emulator.
