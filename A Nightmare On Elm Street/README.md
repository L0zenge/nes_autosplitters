## ANOES Autosplitter for LiveSplit <br />
Splits occur when a key is obtained and when Freddy leaves screen after final boss fight. <br />
<br />
Known bug: If you map your emulator reset and LiveSplit reset to the same key, whenever you have a gold in the splits and LiveSplit is waiting on you to choose 
whether or not to save, the emulator will have already changed states. This causes a fake gold on the current split. <br />
To fix this make sure to reset LiveSplit and accept golds BEFORE resetting the emulator.
#### To Add Script <br />
1. Right click LiveSplit > Edit Split... > Click the plus sign > Control > Scriptable Auto Splitter <br />
1. Double-click new component and Browse to .asl file path. <br />
